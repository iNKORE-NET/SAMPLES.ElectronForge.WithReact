# ElectronForge kickstarter

This is a simple project to get you started with Electron. It uses Electron Forge to manage the Electron app and vanilla JavaScript for the main interface.

All the technologies used in this project are:

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

- [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you click the "Use this template" button on the top right of this page or click [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=SAMPLES.ElectronForge.WithReact&template_owner=iNKORE-NET). This will create a new repository with the same structure as this one.

Clone the repository to your local machine, locate to `packages/main` and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Electron app. You can now start developing your app.
